- 👋 Hi, I’m @septiandjamari.
- 👀 I’m interested in Fullstack Programming, and Data Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter, React.js / React Native, Web (HTML, CSS, Javascript), Laravel, Python, and MySQL.

Maybe now my repositories are still little, but i wish i can add more update in each repository, and add more project in this github account, i wish i can be more productive so i can learn more about programming and updating more in my repositories🙏🙏👍👍.
